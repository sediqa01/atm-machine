# ATM SYSTEM - (Automated Teller Machine)

This a computer-based program that makes managing a bank account’s funds simple. It enables users to check account balances, make cash withdrawals and deposits.

This Python Code For ATM Machine can run in console mode. It has a number of features, including Account Statement, Withdrawal, Depositing Amount. The user must first provide an existing username, and if the username matches, the system will proceed to the following step, which is to ask for a pin number. When a user completes all of these sign-in procedures, he or she will be able to utilize all of the capabilities. It’s far too simple to utilize; he or she can verify their own account statements.

- Click on Deploy.

## Credits

- [Source Code Hero](https://sourcecodehero.com/atm-program-in-python-with-source-code/) - The code for multi-user login was taken from this site. When I decided to build an ATM program , at first my program had one user login, then I thought it would be better if it had a multi-user login. So, I searched on Google and found this site.
- [Learn Scratch Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1aUteSg2a4&list=WL&index=2&t=415s) - This YouTube video helps to learn how to use the **Pyfiglet** library for converting text to big ASCII text using Pyfiglet.
